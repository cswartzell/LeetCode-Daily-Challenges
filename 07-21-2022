Leetcode 86. Partition List: Another sinlgly linked list p[roblem. This one seemed dead easy to be honest, and can easily be done in o(n) by just starting a second list and literally partitioning it as stated. At the end, just link one into the other. I continue to abhor singly linked lists as they seem so arbitrarily limiting, but in programming challenges thats sorta the point. I dont feel like I learned much with this one, but they cant all be educational. At least my instincts and first guess was right for once.
